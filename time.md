# Timekeeping

Note for instructors:

Some commit dates might not line up fully, because:
- sometimes finishing the commit after midnight, I still counted it as the previous day.
- other times before making the commit I like to review my code the next day with fresh eyes to possibly discover new issues. (The work itself happened the previous day, just reviewing and the commit itself was left to the next day.)

I don't think this will be an issue, because I believe this the commits and timekeeping still reasonably match.
